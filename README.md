# Calendar and Period Management Application

This is a React-based application designed to manage and visualize periods (e.g., vacations, internships, courses) in a calendar format. It allows users to input personal information, add and delete periods, and visualize them on a calendar with color-coded legends. The application also supports exporting the calendar to a PDF file.

## Features

- **Working Days Calculation**: The application calculates the number of working days for each month, excluding weekends and Polish holidays.
- **PDF Export**: Users can export the calendar with their personal information to a PDF file.

## Technologies Used
